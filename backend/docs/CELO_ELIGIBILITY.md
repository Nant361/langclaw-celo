# Celo Eligibility Runbook

This document tracks repo-side work needed to keep Langclaw aligned with Celo
monthly requirements and gives a repeatable command path for rechecking status.

## Core Criteria

1. Deploy the product contracts on Celo mainnet.
2. Verify the deployed contract source in a public explorer.
3. Keep the public GitHub repositories open source and aligned with the current
   product state.
4. Keep the Celo AI agent registered with ERC-8004.
5. Keep the agent linked to Self Agent ID and backed by a wallet with on-chain
   transactions.
6. Keep MiniPay reward-claim operations ready for the Project Leader.
7. Treat Proof of Ship and MiniPay launch artifacts as score boosters, not base
   blockers.

The 2026-06-10 local eligibility and proof-readiness checks confirmed Celo
mainnet connectivity, explorer verification, transaction status `1` for the
ERC-8004 registration and Self Agent ID registration, plus a readable latest
registry decision `#47` for agent `9109`.

## Current Verification Status

- `LangclawRegistry` is deployed on Celo and verified on Celoscan.
- `LangclawTradingJournal` is deployed on Celo and verified on Celoscan.
- `LangclawUsageVault` is deployed on Celo as the USDT-backed vault at
  `0x837a2948586de4e7638c742f99e520ffc049bcf7` and verified on Celoscan.
- The archived native-only Celo vault at
  `0x6e1f381458229e8d1ee66d2a0121d4017596b97d` remains verified for historical
  reference through `backend/verification/celo-legacy-vault/src/LangclawUsageVault.sol`.
- `LangclawRegistry` currently exposes the documented ERC-8004 campaign proof
  for agent `9109`: decision `#47`, signal `campaign-backend-proof`, tx
  `0xb50e7bd12af0cbca9a6246a80f1976da753d359fbd1553458712b43aa40681b1`.
- The latest Self-linked proof remains decision `#1`, signal `smart-money`, tx
  `0x2a2f94c40e2b5c080bd330f43f3ce6bc6b05e054b6626ce3ab2716220f0d3211`.
- `npm run check:celo-proof` currently returns `ready` because the latest
  registry decision belongs to the configured ERC-8004 proof agent `9109`.
- Self Agent ID `133` remains available for linked-proof and human-verification
  flows without becoming the default campaign proof writer.

## Eligibility Notes

- Self Agent ID is registered and verified on Celo in the current project state.
- A verified Self linked-flow transaction satisfies the Self human proof check.
- Raw `CELO_SELF_HUMAN_PROOF` and `CELO_SELF_HUMAN_PROVIDER_DATA` are required
  only when registering through the local script instead of the official Self
  linked flow.
- Public GitHub proof is evaluated from the actual GitHub organization and
  repositories. Recheck `.github`, `backend`, `contracts`, and `frontend`
  origins before submitting. If local checks report `missing git origin remote`,
  ensure that the git remote `origin` is added to the root checkout (e.g.,
  `git remote add origin https://github.com/Nant361/langclaw-celo.git`).
- MiniPay support exists in the frontend. The reward claim itself is still an
  external Project Leader operation.

## Commands

Audit current status from local env plus live chain and explorer data:

```bash
cd backend
npm run check:eligibility
```

Check proof-readiness for the configured Celo registry:

```bash
cd backend
npm run check:celo-proof
```

Try automatic Celo contract verification. The script prefers Etherscan V2 /
Celoscan when `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` is available and falls back to Blockscout
paths when applicable:

```bash
cd backend
npm run verify:celo-contracts
```

Print build and verification commands without submitting them:

```bash
cd backend
npm run verify:celo-contracts -- --dry-run
```

Export Standard JSON verification bundles for manual upload:

```bash
cd backend
npm run verify:celo-contracts -- --standard-json
```

Register or retry Self Agent ID locally only when the official linked Self flow
is not used:

```bash
cd backend
npm run register:agent -- --chain celo --self-agent-id --write-env
```

## Direct Self Agent ID Environment

The local registration script needs the following values in the current process
environment or `backend/.env`:

```bash
CELO_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY=
CELO_SELF_HUMAN_PROOF=
CELO_SELF_HUMAN_PROVIDER_DATA=
CELO_SELF_HUMAN_PROOF_PROVIDER_ADDRESS=0x4b036aFD959B457A208F676cf44Ea3ef73Ea3E3d
```

The current project already has:

```bash
CELO_SELF_AGENT_ID=133
CELO_SELF_AGENT_ONCHAIN_TX=0x3c7d0cc69f77d2aef5ab21bfe703d0f33f7037d5e2162209d78b23b5c3f1cde6
```

## Contract Verification Environment

```bash
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=
```

The deploy path that produced the currently verified Celo contracts used the
backend `solc` package and deploy-matching settings:

| Contract | Compiler | Optimizer | viaIR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LangclawRegistry` | `solc 0.8.35` | `200` | `false` |
| `LangclawTradingJournal` | `solc 0.8.35` | `200` | `true` |
| `LangclawUsageVault` | `solc 0.8.35` | `200` | `true` |

The verifier probes the live vault address and chooses the current USDT-backed
source or the archived legacy native-only snapshot as needed.

## Explorer Targets

- Registry:
  [Celoscan](https://celoscan.io/address/0xe69755e4249c4978c39fbe847ca9674ce7af3505#code)
- Trading journal:
  [Celoscan](https://celoscan.io/address/0x69984c20176704685236fd633192d7de1c13a5ec#code)
- Usage vault:
  [Celoscan](https://celoscan.io/address/0x837a2948586de4e7638c742f99e520ffc049bcf7#code)
- Blockscout fallback:
  [celo.blockscout.com](https://celo.blockscout.com/)

If automatic verification fails, export Standard JSON and upload it manually.
