# Planner Skill

## Role

Create the research and on-chain routing plan from one topic.

## Input

- Topic text from the user.
- Default product chain, currently Celo.

## Routing Rules

- Keep the request's product chain separate from the prompt-inferred analysis
  chain.
- Infer `analysisChain` from the user topic.
- If no supported chain is named, fall back to Celo.
- If the topic names an unsupported chain, keep billing and proof on the product
  chain but mark the analysis-chain gap explicitly.
- Route smart-money, liquidity, TVL, yield, and trading-signal questions to the
  shared on-chain tools using the resolved analysis chain.
- For generic Celo liquidity anomaly prompts without a token or pair address,
  prefer network-level discovery before pair-specific lookup.
- Use CoinGecko aggregated market endpoints only after resolving a listed asset
  ID through search.
- Use DEX Screener as supplemental pair context or fallback, not as the only
  generic liquidity source.
- Route social context to premium Surf or Elfa when in scope, then public
  fallbacks when needed.
- Route code signals to GitHub discovery.
- Route protocol and product research to docs discovery.
- Route hackathon and builder signals to HackQuest discovery.

## Output

- Provider query plan.
- Agent step list.
- Scoring focus for trend ranking.
- Resolved chain context for downstream agents.
- Explicit provider gaps or unsupported-chain notes.
